abstract = {The Message Passing Interface Forum (MPIF), with participation from over 40 organizations, has been meeting since November 1992 to discuss and define a set of library standards for message passing. MPIF is not sanctioned or supported by any official standards organization. The goal of the Message Passing Interface, simply stated, is to develop a widely used standard for writing message-passing programs. As such the interface should establish a practical, portable, efficient and flexible standard for message passing. , This is the final report, Version 1.0, of the Message Passing Interface Forum. This document contains all the technical features proposed for the interface. This copy of the draft was processed by LATEX on April 21, 1994. , Please send comments on MPI to mpi-comments@cs.utk.edu. Your comment will be forwarded to MPIF committee members who will attempt to respond.}

abstract = {Scientific data is continually increasing in complexity, variety and size, making efficient visualization and specifically rendering an ongoing challenge. Traditional rasterization-based visualization approaches encounter performance and quality limitations, particularly in HPC environments without dedicated rendering hardware. In this paper, we present OSPRay, a turn-key CPU ray tracing framework oriented towards production-use scientific visualization which can utilize varying SIMD widths and multiple device backends found across diverse HPC resources. This framework provides a high-quality, efficient CPU-based solution for typical visualization workloads, which has already been integrated into several prevalent visualization packages. We show that this system delivers the performance, high-level API simplicity, and modular device support needed to provide a compelling new rendering framework for implementing efficient scientific visualization workflows.},

Because the field is rapidly evolving, a periodic critical assessment of our understanding is useful and this paper seeks to address this need. It covers the emerging research on AM of metallic materials and provides a comprehensive overview of the physical processes and the underlying science of metallurgical structure and properties of the deposited parts. The uniqueness of this review includes substantive discussions on refractory alloys, precious metals and compositionally graded alloys, a succinct comparison of AM with welding and a critical examination of the printability of various engineering alloys based on experiments and theory. An assessment of the status of the field, the gaps in the scientific understanding and the research needs for the expansion of AM of metallic components are provided.},

abstract = {•Orthogonal design was combined with ideal overlap model to ascertain key parameters.•Cooling rate and solidification velocity were the reason for morphological features.•The influence rules of critical parameters on morphology and properties were deduced.•The characteristics of morphology determine the anisotropy of mechanical properties.
Laser Metal Deposition Shaping (LMDS) is a new rapid manufacturing technology, which can build fully-dense metal components directly from the information transferred from a computer file by depositing metal powders layer by layer with neither mould nor tool. Typically, performed with stainless steel (SS) 316 powder, the orthogonal experiments combining with the ideal overlapping model were applied to ascertain the optimal processing parameters. Then the characteristics of microstructure, composition and phase of as-deposited cladding layers were analyzed through Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), as well as relative model. Furthermore, the cooling rate and the solidification velocity during LMDS were evaluated based on empirical method. With the optimal parameters, some parts were fabricated without obvious defects, and then the mechanical properties of them were tested. Finally, the influencing regularities of critical parameters on microstructure and properties were concluded by comparison. The results prove that the microstructure of SS 316 deposits is composed of the slender dendrites growing epitaxially from the substrate, the mechanical properties are favorable and anisotropic, and the composition is uniform. Besides, the microstructure morphology and the mechanical properties are affected by the varied processing parameters at different degrees. Among them, the scanning speed shows the most remarkable effects on microstructure morphology, characteristic microscale, mechanical properties, as well as geometric shape of as-deposited parts.},
